Logistic Regression models the probability of a binary outcome based on input features, providing insight into how each feature influences loan status predictions. Its interpretability is valuable, aiding financial institutions in understanding the factors driving loan approval decisions.}

\subsection{Support Vector Classifier (SVC)}
\large{The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was employed to capture complex decision boundaries within the data. Achieving optimal model performance required extensive hyperparameter tuning. SVC identifies hyperplanes that best separate data into different classes while maximizing margins. This approach is particularly beneficial for complex, non-linear relationships and higher accuracy requirements. Grid searches or random searches systematically explored hyperparameters like kernel type, regularization parameter (C), and kernel-specific parameters. Fine-tuning allowed the SVC to adapt to the dataset's intricacies, enhancing predictive accuracy.}

\subsection{Decision Tree Classifier}
\large{The Decision Tree Classifier, chosen for its ability to model non-linear decision processes, was implemented with meticulous hyperparameter adjustments. Decision trees partition data based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. The tree's depth and splitting criterion were fine-tuned to maximize predictive accuracy. Decision trees are valuable for their interpretability, providing clear insights into influential features affecting loan approval decisions.}

\subsection{Random Forest Classifier}
\large{The Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning method, was introduced to improve predictive performance by combining multiple decision trees. Hyperparameter optimization, including estimator count and tree depth, was performed to enhance model performance. Random Forests mitigate decision tree limitations by aggregating predictions from multiple trees. Each tree is built using different data subsets, resulting in more stable and accurate predictions. Hyperparameter tuning involved systematic exploration of hyperparameter combinations, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of loan status predictions.}
